# 💻 Beginner Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my learning journey as I build small projects in web development and data science. I'm currently exploring tools like **Python**, **JavaScript**, **Node.js**, and **HTML/CSS**, and using this space to grow and track my progress.

##  What You'll Find Here

This repository (and others I'll create soon) will include:
- 🔹 Simple **web apps** using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js
- 🔹 Basic **data analysis** notebooks using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib
- 🔹 Projects that solve small everyday problems
- 🔹 Experiments with APIs, UI, and beginner-friendly code

---

## 🔧 Technologies I’m Learning
- **Python** (for scripting and data analysis)
- **Jupyter Notebooks** (for step-by-step data projects)
- **JavaScript** & **Node.js** (for backend web logic)
- **HTML/CSS** (for frontend design)
- **Git & GitHub** (for version control and collaboration)

---

## 📌 Why This Exists
I'm a complete beginner teaching myself coding by building projects from scratch. I’m sharing them here not because they’re perfect, but because:
- I want to **track my growth**
- I believe learning in public helps me stay accountable
- Someone else might find it useful or inspiring to start too

## ✅ Features (for future projects)
Here are the kinds of features I might add as I learn:
- User authentication (sign-up/login pages)
- Form validation and interactive buttons
- Basic data dashboards or visualizations
- API integrations (e.g., weather apps, quotes, search engines)
- File upload or simple databases (like local storage or MongoDB)
